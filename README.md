API Request Project

Communicating with APIs allows you to work with microservices and with vast databases to build useful tools and relevant information quickly and easily. 

This project is an app for a fictional company called Awesome Startup, a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world. They need a smart way for employees to share contact information with each other.
